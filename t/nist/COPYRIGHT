The files in this directory were extracted from the "sha1-vectors.zip"
archive, which is publicly available through the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) website at the following URL:

	http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/shs.html

The files have been truncated to include only the first 100 test
cases for bit and byte messages.  This was done solely to decrease
the size of the Digest::SHA distribution, thereby making downloads
much quicker for module users.  If a more extensive test run is
desired, simply extract the original files from the archive, and
rename them as follows:

bit-hashes.sha1    -> bithash.sha
bit-messages.sha1  -> bitmsg.sha
byte-hashes.sha1   -> bytehash.sha
byte-messages.sha1 -> bytemsg.sha

NIST advises that the archive file describes "tests and vectors
that can be used to informally verify the correctness of an SHA-1
implementation.  However, use of these vectors does not take the
place of validation obtained through the Cryptographic Module
Validation Program."
