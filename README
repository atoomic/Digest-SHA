Digest::SHA version 4.0.4
=========================

The Digest::SHA module provides a Perl interface to all varieties
of the Secure Hash Algorithm, namely, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and
SHA-512.  Fuctions are also included to compute keyed-hashes using
the HMAC algorithm.

Digest::SHA uses the naming conventions and styles of the Digest
module.  Several features have been added, such as the ability to:

	- calculate digests for bit-oriented messages
	- store and retrieve intermediate SHA states

The underlying C code is portable, and requires no special libraries
beyond those found with typical compilers.  However, if your compiler
doesn't recognize the "long long" type, the functions associated
with SHA-384 and SHA-512 will return null values.

As of Version 4.0, the Digest::SHA module is deprecating the
redundant "shaopen()/shawrite()/shaclose()" interface in favor of
the standard (and more streamlined) object-oriented style.

The tests subdirectory (t/*.t) contains an extensive set of SHA
vectors compiled from various sources.  Of particular interest are
the NIST vectors, which examine a large variety of bit-strings and
byte-strings (see the "t/nist/COPYRIGHT" file for details).  Also
note the bit-vectors supplied by Jim Gillogly and Francois Grieu,
which check the behavior of implementations for input strings that
exceed 2^32 bits in length.

The examples directory, kindly provided by Julius Duque, contains
useful and instructive applications of the SHA digest routines.
Refer to the "finddups" utility (recently featured in The Perl
Journal) for a particularly interesting example.
