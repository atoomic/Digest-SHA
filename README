Digest::SHA version 5.24
========================

Digest::SHA is a complete implementation of the NIST Secure Hash
Standard.  It gives Perl programmers a convenient way to calculate
SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 message digests.
The module can handle all types of input, including partial-byte
data.

Digest::SHA is written in C for speed.  If your platform lacks a
C compiler, you can install the functionally-equivalent (but much
slower) Digest::SHA::PurePerl module.

Please refer to the tests subdirectory (t/*.t) for an extensive
set of SHA vectors compiled from various sources.  Of particular
interest are the NIST vectors, which examine a large variety of
bit-strings and byte-strings.

INSTALLATION
