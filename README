Digest::SHA version 5.00
========================

The Digest::SHA module provides an easy way to compute message
digests using Perl.  It supports all algorithms of the NIST Secure
Hash Standard (i.e. SHA-1, 224, 256, 384, and 512).  The module
also includes functions to compute keyed-hashes using the HMAC
algorithm.

Digest::SHA conforms to the naming conventions and styles of the
CPAN Digest module.  Several features have been added, such as the
ability to:

	- calculate digests for bit-oriented messages
	- store and retrieve intermediate SHA states

The underlying C code is portable, and requires no special libraries.
However, unless your compiler supports a 64-bit integral type (e.g.
the "long long" of C99, or the "__int64" of Microsoft C), the
routines associated with SHA-384 and SHA-512 will return null
values.

This module inherits from Digest::base if the latter is installed
on your platform.  If the base class is not present, Digest::SHA
still works; it simply uses its own local routines to supply the
missing functionality.

Please refer to the tests subdirectory (t/*.t) for an extensive
set of SHA vectors compiled from various sources.  Of particular
interest are the NIST vectors, which examine a large variety of
bit-strings and byte-strings.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL [ options ]
	make
	make test
	make install

The Makefile.PL options are:

	-t : build a thread-safe version of module
	-x : exclude support for SHA-384/512
