Digest::SHA version 4.0.6
=========================

The Digest::SHA module provides an easy way to compute message
digests using Perl.  It supports all algorithms of the NIST Secure
Hash Standard (i.e. SHA-1, 256, 384, and 512).  The module also
includes functions to compute keyed-hashes using the HMAC algorithm.

Digest::SHA conforms to the naming conventions and styles of the
CPAN Digest module.  Several features have been added, such as the
ability to:

	- calculate digests for bit-oriented messages
	- store and retrieve intermediate SHA states

The underlying C code is portable, and requires no special libraries.
However, if your compiler doesn't recognize the "long long" type,
the routines associated with SHA-384 and SHA-512 will return null
values.

Version 4.0.6 focuses on further performance enhancements.  All
time-critical functions and methods have been rewritten in XS.
Digest::SHA now compares favorably with other CPAN SHA modules in
terms of performance.  Its speed on big-endian platforms is often
significantly greater (e.g. when using the benchmark developed by
Digest::  author Gisle Aas).

Please refer to the tests subdirectory (t/*.t) for an extensive
set of SHA vectors compiled from various sources.  Of particular
interest are the NIST vectors, which examine a large variety of
bit-strings and byte-strings.
