To use the Perl script, "hashfile", type:

        ./hashfile file1 [file2 file3 ...]

where file1, file2, file3, ... are the files you want to hash, e.g.,

        ./hashfile README resume.doc refman.pdf

hashfile takes at least one file as argument.

The Perl script, "strings", hashes different strings using the different
flavors of SHA. The use of the method hashsize() is also illustrated.
