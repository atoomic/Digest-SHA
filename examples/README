To use the Perl script, "hashfile", type:

        ./hashfile <file>

where <file> is the file you want to hash, e.g.,

        ./hashfile README

Only one file can be hashed, though.

The Perl script, "strings", hashes different strings using the different
flavors of SHA. The use of the method hashsize() is also illustrated.
