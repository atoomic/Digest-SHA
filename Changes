Revision history for Perl extension Digest::SHA.

3.1 Sun Nov 30 15:53:06 PHT 2003 (Julius C. Duque)
    - added test vectors compiled by Aaron Gifford
      ({me}{at}{aarongifford}{dot}{com}), two of which can
      reveal bugs in the SHA 256/384/512 implementations;
      see t/gifford/*.info for descriptions of these tests

    - added hashsize() method (in SHA.pm) that returns the hash length
      (in bytes) used; valid return values are 20, 32, 48, and 64
      (for SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, respectively)

    - added "examples" directory, which contains working Perl scripts
      that show how to use Digest::SHA

    - tweaked Makefile.PL
        -- module Digest::base (by Gisle Aas) is now required
        -- added COMPRESS and SUFFIX options

3.0 Wed Nov 26 05:02:34 MST 2003 (Mark Shelor)
    - added functions that conform to Digest:: interface
        -- both functional and OO styles
            -- byte-oriented data only

        -- continue to support original interface as well
            -- necessary for bit-oriented data

    - supplied formal test vectors for HMAC-SHA-256
        -- from draft-ietf-ipsec-ciph-sha-256-01.txt

    - included tests for all OO methods

2.4 Sat Nov 22 17:10:22 MST 2003 (Mark Shelor)
    - code cleanup
        -- "sha.c" now completely free of #ifdef's

    - modularized all 64-bit (long long) code
    - improved readability of header files
    - simplified logic of "fixdump" utility

2.3 Wed Nov 19 03:54:31 MST 2003 (Mark Shelor)
    - minor optimizations and code cleanup
        -- improved maintainability by reducing #ifdef's
        -- sha1 transform code now easier to follow

    - streamlined shadump/shaload file format
        -- eliminated special "HQ" entry
        -- state now held in "H" for all transforms
        -- supplied "fixdump" utility to convert old format

    - SHA-384/512 functions now return NULL for no 64-bit operations
        -- previously they were undefined
        -- no longer necessary to use eval's to test for presence

2.2 Sun Nov 16 01:54:00 MST 2003 (Mark Shelor)
    - optimized the performance of the SHA-1 transform
        -- around 20-30% faster than previous version
        -- achieved by loop unrolling and assignment consolidation

    - enhanced shaload/shadump to allow interaction with stdin/stdout
        -- "$filename" argument now optional

2.1 Sun Nov 9 03:28:04 MST 2003 (Mark Shelor)
    - simplified data input routines
        -- length argument now optional for byte data (special thanks to
           Jeffrey Friedl for this idea)

        -- interface still compatible with earlier versions
        -- changes will not affect existing client code

    - streamlined underlying C code for easier maintenance
    - provided additional tests for persistent data

2.0 Sat Nov 1 03:55:36 MST 2003 (Mark Shelor)
    - added functions for HMAC-SHA-1/256/384/512 (FIPS PUB 198)
    - shadump/shaload files now compatible between 32/64-bit machines

1.01 Sat Oct 25 02:44:55 MST 2003 (Mark Shelor)
    - package now downloads and installs much faster
    - reduced distribution size by 80%
        -- pruned extensive NIST vectors to a useful subset
        -- still possible to test all vectors if desired
            --- see "t/nist/COPYRIGHT" file for details

    - added routines to provide persistent storage of SHA states
        -- shadump() and shaload()

    - reduced runtime of large bitstring tests (gillogly-hard)
        -- illustrates usefulness of shadump()/shaload()

1.0 Sat Oct 18 17:35:07 MST 2003 (Mark Shelor)
    - documentation fixes
    - code cleanup: no more compiler warnings from gcc -Wall
    - added code to allow reading of intermediate digest state
        -- shahex() prior to shafinish() returns current state

0.9 Thu Oct 9 20:43:54 MST 2003 (Mark Shelor)
    - version updated to reflect portability check and passing
      of all tests (1401)

0.01 Wed Oct 8 22:28:05 2003 (Mark Shelor)
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options

        -x -A -n Digest::SHA sha.h
